        As a software engineer with a background in client facing roles, I am able to easily communicate with clients on their specific issues in order to evaluate and meet their needs . In my past roles, I have been able to build strong relationships with clients and colleagues which in turn has led to leadership roles within my organizations. I look forward to utilizing these skills in tandem with the tech skills that I have gained in order to build applications that help individuals companies alike compete in the world of business. I thrive on the details that make things operate efficiently and figuring out the issues when they donâ€™t.
