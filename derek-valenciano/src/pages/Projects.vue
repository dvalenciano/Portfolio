      <img class="project-img" src="../assets/hops.png">
      <p class="home-open">This project was created as a full stack application that will store recipes that brewers create for later use or expansion and tracking. As a brewer there is a good amount of time from the actual brew date to when a beer has finished fermenting and is ready for consumption and that time many details can be forgtten. This application is aimed at tracking those details and recipes for brewers to access with ease and confidence of the data.</p>

      <h3>Connect 4 Space Edition</h3>
      <img class="project-img" src="../assets/connect4.png">
      <p class="home-open">The idea behind this project is to show the start of an engineering immersive career path and to help document where I am at in that journey. It will also serve as a baseline that can then be looked back on to help show the improvments that have been made as more experience has been gained. For me this gmae is about having fun while implementing the principles that have been picked up in the first unit of this immersive training.</p>
